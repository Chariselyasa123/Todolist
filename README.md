## Description

This Todo List App is a simple app that allows you to create, read, update, and delete todo items. I use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) 
for getting started in this app, For more detail about Create React App (CRA) please visit [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

For styling, I use the design **concept** of Neumorphism. For more-detail about
Neumorphism, [Click Here](https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/neumorphism). **Neumorphism is not CSS framework**, but
it is
a **concept** that I use to design my Todo App.
